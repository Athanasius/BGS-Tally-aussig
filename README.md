# Usage
BGS Tally v2.0 counts all the BGS work you do for any faction, in any system. 
It is highly reccomended that EDMC is started before ED is lauched as Data is recorded at startup and then when you dock at a station. Not doing this can result in missing data.
The data is shown on a pop up window when the Data Today button on the EDMC main screen is pushed.
The plugin can paused in the BSG Tally v2.0 tab in settings.

Only four positive actions are counted at the moment. Mission inf + , Total trade profit sold to Faction controlled station, Cartographic data sold to Faction controlled station, Bounties issued by named Faction. These total during the session and reset at server tick.

Users will be notified if there is a new version is avalible.
